Vesting
=======

What Is Vesting? 
It's a certain amount of tokens that are held aside for some period of time for the team, 
partners, advisors, and others who are contributing to the development of the project. 
Smart contracts usually lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met.

Token vesting refers to locking up investors tokens for a specific period to maintain a stable 
long-term value of a particular (digital) asset.

.. note::
    Startups that use the blockchain technology might lock a certain amount of 
    tokens: the team can reserve a certain percentage of coins, which will be gradually released 
    once a month/quarter/year during the project process for financial purposes. 
    *In general terms, the process of releasing these coins is called vesting.* 
    Vesting is usually used to show that the team is highly interested in the project, and 
    will continue working on project development. Additionally, vesting lowers market price 
    manipulations. 

What Is a Cliff?
================

There is often a several-year **“cliff”**, meaning that the individual must 
be with the company for a couple of years to release the first increment of tokens.

Superfluid Protocol
+++++++++++++++++++

**Superfluid** is a new token standard, with the power to describe cashflows, 
and execute them automatically on chain over time in a non-interactive way.

Superfluid flows are programmable, composable and modular. Our first cashflow 
types allow constant streams of value, and one-to-many distributions.

All flows are settled at the same time, based on block timestamps. This makes it 
possible to net inflows and outflows, increasing capital efficiency.

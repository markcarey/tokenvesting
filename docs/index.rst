What is token vesting?
----------------------

Startups that use the blockchain technology might lock a certain amount of tokens: the 
team can reserve a certain percentage of coins, which will be gradually released once a 
month/quarter/year during the project process for financial purposes. In general terms, 
the **process of releasing these coins** is called vesting. 


What are the benefits of Token Vesting?
---------------------------------------

Vesting is usually used to show that the team is **highly interested** in the project, and will 
continue working on project development. Additionally, vesting lowers market price 
manipulations. It also helps to **maintain a stable long-term value** of a particular 
(digital) asset.
